# Code of Conduct  

## 🌱 Our Community Values  

This project is about more than code — it is about cultivating tools that respect human learning and independence.  
We ask everyone who participates to honor these values:  

- **Respect the learner.** Every decision should serve the learner’s autonomy, never their dependency.  
- **Be generous.** Share knowledge and contributions freely, encourage others, and give credit.  
- **Be kind.** Debate ideas, not people. Criticism should be constructive and aimed at the work, never the person.  
- **Celebrate independence.** Remember that the goal is for learners to leave the tool behind.

## 🤝 Expected Behaviors  

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.  
- Respect different perspectives and experiences.  
- Be patient with those new to GitHub, coding, or learning theory.  
- Assume good intent in discussions.  

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behaviors  

- Harassment, discrimination, or disrespect in any form.  
- Dismissing or ridiculing contributions in bad faith.  
- Promoting features or business models that contradict the **scaffolding principle** (e.g., endless engagement loops, ads, manipulative gamification).  

---

## 🛠 Enforcement  

- Issues will first be addressed with a **gentle reminder** of our values.  
- Repeated or severe violations may result in removal from discussions or contributions.

## 🌍 Our Ethos  

We are building tools that **fade gracefully** in service of human growth.  
Contributors are guardians of this ethos.  
Let’s create something that celebrates the most wonderful thing in the universe: **the human mind**.
