# Support scaffold-for-mind-palace

##  Why Support Matters

This project is entirely **free and learner-centered**.
By donating, you're not buying features—but practicing **generosity**, reinforcing the values of independence, growth, and open learning.

##  How You Can Support

### 1. Financial Donations
While optional, donations help sustain hosting, documentation, design improvements, and more:

### 2. Non-Financial Support
Your contributions matter—whether or not you donate:

- Share your **stories or testimonials** about how your memory palace practice helped you.
- **Help others** get started, through encouraging comments or tutorials.
- Contribute to **translation**, **UI design**, or **documentation**.

##  Our Promise

We will **never lock features**, show ads, or pressure you into engagement.  
Donations help us maintain freedom for all users—especially those who rely on this tool to build independence, not dependency.

Thank you for helping us build a future where learners transcend tools rather than remain tethered to them.
