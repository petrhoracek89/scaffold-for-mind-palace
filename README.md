# scaffold-for-mind-palace  
### An AI scaffolding tool for creating memory palaces  

---

## 🌱 Our Philosophy (Short)  

This project is built on one guiding principle:  
> **AI as a scaffold, not a crutch.**  

Unlike apps that keep users hooked with ads, streaks, or subscriptions, this tool is designed to **fade away**.  
Its goal is for you to **learn the memory palace method** and then no longer need the tool.  

- **Temporary support** → the tool steps back as you grow.  
- **Personalized learning** → adapts to each learner’s journey.  
- **True independence** → success means you leave the scaffold behind.
