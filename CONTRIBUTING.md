# Contributing to scaffold-for-mind-palace  

âœ¨ First of all: thank you for wanting to contribute! âœ¨  

This project is about **scaffolding without entrapment**:  
AI should **enhance human capacities** and then **fade away**, leaving the learner independent.  
Every contribution should respect and strengthen this principle.

## ðŸ§­ Guiding Questions  

When suggesting features, always ask:  

- Does this help learners build autonomy?  
- Or are we making them reliant on the tool?  
- Is this scaffolding that can **dissolve over time**?  

If the answer leans toward reliance or endless engagement â†’ rethink.

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute  

### 1. Issues & Suggestions  
- Open an issue if you have an idea, bug report, or feature suggestion.  
- Clearly explain how it aligns with the **scaffolding principle**.  

### 2. Pull Requests  
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.  
- Keep changes focused (small, meaningful pull requests are easier to review).  
- Describe in your PR how the change supports learner independence.  

### 3. Documentation  
- Improving explanations, guides, or examples is just as valuable as code.  
- Clear documentation helps new learners and contributors.  

### 4. Community  
- Be respectful, supportive, and generous.  
- Remember: this project is built to **help people leave it behind** â€” celebrate when learners no longer need it.
